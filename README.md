# Minimal Live Flight Tracker

This is a live flight tracker that is written purely in vanilla javascript, html and css. I tried to keep code as much as minimal possible to have some lightweight flight tracker.

### Limitations
It uses OpenSky Network for live flight data and it makes API calls anonymously which has limitations. Check console to see if there is any errors while making api calls at "refresh map" button.
