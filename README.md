# Minimal Live Flight Tracker

It is a live flight tracker that is written purely in vanilla javascript, html and css. I tried to keep the code as much as minimal possible to have some lightweight flight tracker.

Since it is very lightweight, it can be hosted on github pages. Here is the website link for this repo:

### Limitations
It uses OpenSky Network API for live flight data and it makes API calls anonymously which has limitations. Because of this, instead of automatically refreshing data on the background, there is a "refresh map" button. Check console to see if there is any errors while making api calls at "refresh map" button.
